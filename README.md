===================

For the "Do More" page

we are pulling in data from a spreadsheet

do we have the sheet yet?

In your Javascript, you simply do a var googleSpreadshet = loadSpreadSheet("<key>"); to load your spreadsheet. You will need to edit the function outputSpreadsheet to change how the data is displayed.

You will need jQuery to use the output function
